          Dogs of the Affenpinscher breed were originally created to act as
          ratters in homes, stables, and shops. Bred down in size, they moved up
          in the world, becoming ladies’ companions. Today, they are happy,
          mischievous companion dogs.

          The Afghan Hound is elegance personified. This unique, ancient dog
          breed has an appearance quite unlike any other: dramatic silky coat,
          exotic face, and thin, fashion-model build. Looks aside, Afghan
          enthusiasts describe this hound as both aloof and comical.

          Known as the “King of Terriers,” the Airedale is indeed the largest of
          all terriers. The dog breed originated in the Aire Valley of Yorkshire
          and was created to catch otters and rats in the region between the
          Aire and Wharfe Rivers. An able sporting dog, they became an ideal
          working dog as well, proving their worth during World War I.
